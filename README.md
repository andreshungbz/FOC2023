# Fundamentals of Computing

The Fundamentals of Computing [CMPS1134] final project for the course at the University of Belize consists of building a website that demonstrates concepts that are learned over the course of the semester. Students are required to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript to the best of their abilities and use the resourses available from the lecturer to customize the website to their liking.

This project was done by Group 5 for the Section 2 class with [@kryan](https://github.com/kryanbz) in the 2023-1 semester. Our group members are: Andres Hung ([@andreshungbz](https://github.com/andreshungbz)), Jennessa Sierra ([@jennxsierra](https://github.com/jennxsierra)), Tysha Daniels ([@aoideee](https://github.com/aoideee)), and Gian Dorian ([@gcplays2022](https://github.com/gcplays2022)).

This repository contains the source code for the individual project done by myself as well as the links to the other group members' projects.

Technologies used include Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS.
