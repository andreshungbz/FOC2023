            This course is an introduction to the fundamentals of Computer
            Science that will provide students with a foundation for future
            courses in Computer Science. The course is a broad survey of the
            discipline through topics that allow students to understand the
            capabilities of computer systems in terms of: the computer
            architecture; operating systems and computer networks; software and
            software development; data organization and visualization; and the
            potential of computing machines.

            The Fundamentals of Computing [CMPS1134] course is the course
            offered by the University of Belize as one of the first professional
            core courses for students majoring in Information Technology.
